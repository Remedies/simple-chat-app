## Javascript/ES6 Express and Socket.io Chat application

This is a practice application for me to learn the basics of socket.io. 

### Requirements
Running this application is simple and only requires a few components.

1. Make sure node.js(12+) is installed on your machine 
2. Clone this repository
3. Run "npm install" in the project directory
4. Run "npm run server"
5. Use multiple browsers to visit http://localhost:5000/ (to simulate multiple clients) and chat with yourself 

### Features
* **Chat in real-time** - This project uses socket.io which allows for real data to be transferred between clients and the express server.

* **Know if other clients are typing** - Indicator that displays if a client is typing.
